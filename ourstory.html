    Sparkle Soap was founded by a group of four former non-sparklers. Tired of spending day in and day out simply existing among their peers, they worked together to create a product called Sparkle Soap to change the lives of themselves and others.

    Sparkle Soap is a non-toxic soap that semi-permanently alters skin to glimmer in light. Simply by washing with Sparkle Soap, any affected areas of the body absorb the glitter and diamond pigments within the soap and shimmer in contact with any light.

    A quick swipe will give you a hint of color or shimmery glitter, evening out your skin tone for a beautiful glow. A full bath or longer exposure to the soap will give a more dramatic effect that will last for up to 4 weeks.
