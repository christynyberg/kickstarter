      <p>US Weekly calls Sparkle Soap "a fizzy, fun, frothy experience" in their January issue. The US Weekly team gave our Sparkle Bombs to staff in their holiday gift bags and said the entire office has never smelled or looked better. What a way to start the New Year!</p>
      <p>We love the rave reviews and want to make sure everyone can sparkle.</p>
